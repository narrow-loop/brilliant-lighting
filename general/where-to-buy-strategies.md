# Where to buy strategies

### ChatGPT answered

It depends a lot on how much you‚Äôre willing to pay, the markets you trade (stocks, forex, crypto, futures, etc.), and how ‚Äúhands‚Äëoff‚Äù you want it (just signals vs fully automated execution). But yes ‚Äî there **are** services and platforms that let you buy or subscribe to short‚Äëterm trading strategies or signals. Below are some options + caveats + tips.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats, Risks & What to Watch Out For

Before subscribing to any strategy or signal service, you should be cautious. Here are some red flags and things to check:

* **Past performance ‚â† future returns**: Many services highlight past winning trades, but markets change.
* **Transparency**: Do they show full trade histories, drawdowns, losing trades? Or only cherry‚Äëpicked results?
* **Fees / Profit sharing**: Some services charge a flat subscription, others a performance fee, or both.
* **Slippage, execution risk, latency**: If they send signals but you execute yourself, you might get worse fills.
* **Compatibility & automation**: Check whether the signals integrate with your broker / trading platform (e.g. via API, MT4, MT5, etc.).
* **Risk management**: The service should include stop losses, maximum drawdown limits, position sizing rules.
* **Reputation & reviews**: Search forums, ask for verified results, be critical of bold claims.
* **Regulation / legal risk**: Some signal services may be unregulated. Always do due diligence.

## üéØ What fits *you*

To narrow it down:

* Which markets are you interested in? (Forex, crypto, stocks, futures, etc.)
* Do you want fully automated execution, or just alerts / signals that you act on?
* What‚Äôs your budget / max you‚Äôre willing to pay per month or per trade?
* How much trust / verification do you need before you commit?

If you like, I can **filter down to services available in Taiwan / Asia**, or ones that support your markets and broker, and send you a curated list. Do you want me to find those for you?
