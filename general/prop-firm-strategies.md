Good question — and you’re right to be cautious. Many strategies look good in **backtests or in a certain market regime**, but then collapse in live conditions or under **prop firm rules** (like FTMO’s). Let’s break this down:

---

## 1. What Makes Prop Firms Different (e.g., FTMO)

Prop firms like FTMO have unique **evaluation criteria** and **risk rules**:

* **Max daily loss** (e.g., -5%)
* **Max total loss / drawdown** (e.g., -10%)
* **Profit target within limited time (30 days)**
* **Consistency checks** (no martingale, no huge lot swings, etc.)
* **Leverage is high, but risk is capped**

So even if a strategy is profitable long-term, it might fail an FTMO challenge because of **short-term variance** or drawdown spikes.

## 2. Strategy Types That Have Worked in Prop Firm Contexts

While no strategy is universally profitable forever, some categories have shown robustness in **retail + prop trading setups**:

### ✅ **Trend Following (Breakout Systems)**

* Works best in volatile markets (indices, gold, oil, crypto).
* Uses momentum or volatility breakouts.
* Example: trade when price breaks previous day’s high/low with ATR-based stop.
* Good because: often small drawdowns, scalable across assets.
* Weakness: choppy/ranging environments can cause whipsaws.

---

### ✅ **Mean Reversion / Pullback Trading**

* Works well on liquid assets like EURUSD, S\&P500.
* Example: buy dips in uptrends, sell rallies in downtrends, with strict stop loss.
* Good because: higher win rate (confidence boost for challenge periods).
* Weakness: can blow up if strong trend continues without pullback.

---

### ✅ **News/Event Trading**

* Prop traders often exploit **volatility spikes** (NFP, CPI, FOMC).
* Scalp small moves with tight stops and fast exits.
* Good because: quick profit, often enough to meet monthly targets in 1–2 good trades.
* Weakness: slippage, spreads, and execution risk.

---

### ✅ **Scalping with Risk Management**

* Small frequent trades, usually on indices (US30, NAS100, DAX).
* High win-rate systems (60–70%+), targeting 1–2R.
* Good because: can adapt to FTMO’s daily loss rule.
* Weakness: requires very low latency and discipline (no overtrading).

---

### ✅ **Statistical Arbitrage / Pairs Trading**

* Trade correlated assets (e.g., EURUSD vs GBPUSD, or indices vs futures).
* Enter when spread diverges, exit when it mean-reverts.
* Good because: market-neutral, lower drawdown risk.
* Weakness: requires coding + robust backtesting.

## 3. Proven Factors in Prop-Firm-Friendly Strategies

The ones that **pass FTMO or MyForexFunds evaluations** tend to share:

* **Risk per trade ≤ 1%** (sometimes 0.5% or less).
* **Diversified instruments** (not only EURUSD).
* **Moderate leverage** (don’t max out).
* **Focus on risk-adjusted return**, not raw profit.

Even profitable hedge fund strategies get adapted for prop rules:

* Lower drawdown profile.
* High Sharpe ratio over raw CAGR.
* Consistent risk sizing.

---

## 4. Caveats

* **No strategy is permanently profitable** — markets evolve.
* **Publicly available strategies** often degrade once they spread.
* What works for one trader may not work for another (psychology + execution).

---

✅ **Short Answer:**
Yes, strategies that rely on **trend following, pullback/mean reversion, event trading, disciplined scalping, and stat-arb** have been proven profitable **and can be adapted to prop firm rules**.

But the **key is risk control and consistency**, not just profitability — otherwise, even a great strategy can fail an FTMO challenge due to one bad day.
